		<br></div><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--21">High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--22">  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--23">He was very much admired indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--24">  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,” remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--25">“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--26">asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--27">  “The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--28">“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--29">“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--30">“How do you know?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--31">said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen one.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--32">“Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--33">but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--34">One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--35">  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--36">  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--37">“Shall I love you?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--38">said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--39">  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--40">  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--41">“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--42">  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--43">After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--44">  “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--45">  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--46">  “I admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--47">“Will you come away with me?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--48">he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--49">“You have been trifling with me,” he cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--50">  “I am off to the Pyramids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--51">  Good-bye!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--52">and he flew away. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--53">All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--54">  “Where shall I put up?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--55">he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--56">Then he saw the statue on the tall column. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--57">“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--58">  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--59">“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--60">  “What a curious thing!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--61">he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--62">  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--63">  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--64">Then another drop fell. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--65">“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--66">he said; “I must look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--67">But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw—Ah!  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--68">what did he see? </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--69">The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--70">  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--71">“Who are you?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--72">he said. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--73">“I am the Happy Prince.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--74">“Why are you weeping then?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--75">asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--76">“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--77">  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--78">  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--79">  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--80">  So I lived, and so I died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--81">  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--82">“What!  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--83">is he not solid gold?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--84">said the Swallow to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--85">  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--86">“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a little street there is a poor house. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--87">  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--88">  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--89">  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--90">  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--91">  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--92">  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--93">  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--94">  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--95">“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--96">  “My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--97">  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--98">  The King is there himself in his painted coffin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--99">  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--100">  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--101">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--102">  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--103">“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--104">  “Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were always throwing stones at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--105">  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--106">But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--107">  “It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--108">“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--109">So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--110">He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--111">  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--112">  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--113">  “How wonderful the stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--114">“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered; “I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--115">He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--116">  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--117">  At last he came to the poor house and looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--118">  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--119">  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--120">  Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--121">  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and he sank into a delicious slumber. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--122">Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--123">  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--124">“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--125">  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--126">  Thinking always made him sleepy. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--127">When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--128">  “What a remarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--129">  “A swallow in winter!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--130">  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--131">  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--132">“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--133">  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--134">  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--135">so he enjoyed himself very much. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--136">When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--137">  “Have you any commissions for Egypt?”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--138">he cried; “I am just starting.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--139">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--140">“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--141">  “To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--142">  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--143">  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--144">  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--145">  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--146">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--147">  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--148">  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--149">  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--150">  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--151">“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--152">  “Shall I take him another ruby?” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--153">“Alas! </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--154">  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--155">  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--156">  Pluck out one of them and take it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--157">  He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--158">“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to weep. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--159">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--160">So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the student’s garret. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--161">  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--162">  Through this he darted, and came into the room. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--163">  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--164">“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great admirer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--165">  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--166">The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--167">  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--168">  “Heave a-hoy!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--169">they shouted as each chest came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--170">  “I am going to Egypt”!  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--171">cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--172">“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--173">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--174">“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--175">  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--176">  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--177">  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--178">  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--179">“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--180">  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--181">  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--182">  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--183">  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--184">“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--185">  You would be quite blind then.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--186">“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--187">So he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--188">  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--189">  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--190">Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--191">  “You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with you always.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--192">“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--193">“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--194">All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--195">  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--196">“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--197">  There is no Mystery so great as Misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--198">  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--199">So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--200">  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--201">  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--202">  “How hungry we are!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--203">they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--204">  “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--205">Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--206">“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--207">Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--208">  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--209">  “We have bread now!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--210">they cried. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--211">Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--212">  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--213">The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--214">  He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--215">But at last he knew that he was going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--216">  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--217">  “Good-bye, dear Prince!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--218">he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--219">“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--220">“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--221">  “I am going to the House of Death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--222">  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--223">And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--224">At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--225">  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--226">  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--227">Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--228">  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: “Dear me!  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--229">how shabby the Happy Prince looks!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--230">he said. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--231">“How shabby indeed!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--232">cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--233">“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle beter than a beggar!” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--234">“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--235">“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--236">continued the Mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--237">  “We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--238">  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--239">So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--240">  “As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the University. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--241">Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--242">  “We must have another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of myself.” </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--243">“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--244">  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--245">“What a strange thing!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--246">said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--247">  “This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--248">  We must throw it away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1-en--249">  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--250">“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird. </span></p><p><span class="sentence" id="1-en--251">“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.” </span></p><div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br>

смотрит на звезды, а когда появляется первый солнечный луч лишь один горький стон вырывается из него, и потом он опять пребывает в безмолвии.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--173">В полночь, огромные желтые львы спускаются к реке, чтобы напиться воды.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--174">Их глаза светятся в ночи, подобно зеленоватым бериллам, а грозный рык звучит

верхушки пальм, крокодилы нежатся в теплой тине, и лениво посматривают на все вокруг.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--215">Мои друзья строят гнездо в Баальбеке, а белые и розовые голуби воркуют, наблюдая за ними.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--216">Дорогой Принц, я должен улетать, но я никогда не забуду тебя.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--217">Следующей весной я принесу тебе два прекрасных драгоценных камня, вместо тех, которые ты отдал.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--218">Рубин будет алее красных роз, а сапфир голубее Великого Моря”. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--219">“Там внизу, на площади, — сказал Счастливый Принц, — стоит маленькая девочка, которая продает спички.  </span><span

Принц.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--228">— сделай, как я велю тебе”. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--229">Скворец выклевал второй глаз Принца, и ринулся вниз.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--230">Он промелькнул мимо девочки, а когда она опомнилась, в ее ладони сверкал сапфир.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--231">“Какая стекляшечка!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--232">— обрадовано сказала она, и весело побежала домой. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--233">Скворец вернулся к Принцу и сказал: “Ты теперь совсем слеп, и я останусь с тобой навсегда”.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--234">“Нет, маленький мой Скворец, — сказал несчастный принц, — тебе пора лететь в Египет”.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--235">“Я останусь с тобой навсегда”, — повторил Скворец, и заснул в ногах у Принца. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--236">Уже рано утром он сидел на плече у Принца и рассказывал ему все, что он видел за морем.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--237">Он рассказал про красных ибисов, которые стоят вдоль берегов Нила, и ловят своими клювами золотых рыбок; про Сфинкса, который стар как мир, живет один в страшной пустыне, и знает все что происходит на земле; про торговцев, чинно путешествующих на спинах своих верблюдов с янтарными четками в руках; про черного, как смола, Царя Лунных </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--238">Гор, который поклоняется Сияющему Кристаллу; про огромного зеленого змея, который живет на пальме, а двадцать жрецов кормят его сладкими лепешками; про карликов, которые переплывают озера на листьях гигантских деревьев, и вечно воюют с бабочками. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--239">“Добрый мой Скворец, — сказал Принц.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--240">— Ты

городом, и увидел богатых, веселящихся во все дни светло, и нищих сидящих у ворот их.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--244">Он полетел по темным переулкам, и увидел изможденные лица голодных детей, устало смотревших на пустынные, черные улицы.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--245">Под аркой моста, обнявшись, чтобы хоть немного согреться, лежали два мальчика.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--246">“Есть хочется” — еле слышно шептали они.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--247">“Здесь лежать не положено!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--248">— прокричал им Смотритель Порядка, и они побрели куда-то под проливным дождем. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--249">Скворец вернулся, и рассказал Принцу все, что увидел.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--250">“Я весь покрыт чистым золотом”, — отвечал Принц.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--251">“Сними его, и раздай моим беднякам; люди уверены, что золото может сделать их счастливыми”. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--252">Листочек за листочком Скворец снимал золото, пока Счастливый Принц не стал совсем серым и печальным.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--253">Листочек за листочком он разносил золото бедным, и на лицах детей появился румянец.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--254">“У нас есть хлеб”, — радостно кричали они, играя друг с другом и весело толкаясь.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--255">Потом пришел Снег, а за ним и Мороз.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--256">Улицы стали такими светлыми и блистающими, словно они были сделаны из стекла.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--257">Хрустальными кинжалами свисали с крыш длинные сосульки.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--258">Жители завернулись в шубы, а дети, надев теплые шапочки, помчались на каток. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--259">Маленький Скворец все больше и больше замерзал.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--260">Когда булочник не видел его, он подбирал крошки перед дверью кондитерской.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--261">Бедняжка пытался согреться, хлопая крыльями.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--262">Наконец он понял, что умирает.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--263">Собрав свои силы, он последний раз взлетел на плечо Счастливого Принца.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--264">“Прощайте, дорогой Принц!  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--265">— выговорил он.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--266">— Разрешите мне поцеловать Вашу руку”. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--267">“Маленький Скворец, я рад, что ты наконец-то побываешь в Египте, — сказал Принц.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--268">— Ты слишком долго здесь задержался.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--269">Но тебе надо поцеловать меня в губы, ведь я люблю тебя”.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--270">“Но я отправляюсь не в Египет, —

class="sentence" id="2-en-US--273">Он поцеловал Счастливого Принца в губы, и упал на его туфли.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--274">В этот момент, странный треск прозвучал внутри памятника, будто что-то разбилось.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--275">Это оловянное сердце раскололось надвое. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--276">Был жуткий мороз.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--277">Следующим утром, Городской Глава проходил по площади, окруженный своими Советниками.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--278">Подойдя к колонне он поднял </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--279">голову вверх.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--280">“Бог ты мой!  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--281">— воскликнул он.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--282">Наш Принц-то совсем поистрепался!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--283">“Действительно”, — сказали Советники, которые всегда соглашались с Главой, и тоже посмотрели наверх. </span></p><p class="calibre1"><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--284">“Рубин выпал, глаз больше нет, и позолота облезла, — сказал Глава.  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--285">— Ничуть не лучше нищего!”  </span><span class="sentence" id="2-en-US--286">“Ничуть не
